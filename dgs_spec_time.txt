On DGS there are 3 time-systems in use:

   1. Japanese Byo-yomi
   2. Canadian Byo-yomi
   3. Fischer time

#-------- (0) Time-Formats ----------------------------------------------------

All text-representations are asserted on in unit-test TimeFormatTest.

Text-representation of time-formats for time-limits:

   "J: M + B * P"    : Japanese byo-yomi, M=main-time, B=Byo-yomi-time, P=Byo-yomi-periods
   "J: M"            : Japanese byo-yomi, M=main-time, Absolute time (without byo-yomi)

   "C: M + B / P"    : Canadian byo-yomi, M=main-time, B=Byo-yomi-time, P=Byo-yomi-stones
   "C: M"            : Canadian byo-yomi, M=main-time, Absolute time (without byo-yomi)

   "F: M + B"        : Fischer time, M=main-time, B=extra-time per move
   "F: M"            : Fischer time, M=main-time, Absolute time (without extra-time)

   For time-formats, there also exists the long-text form.


Text-representation of time-formats for remaining-time:

* all formats for JAP/CAN/FIS-time:
   - m/B/b = "Xd Yh" (X days, Y hours), e.g. "2d 3h", "10d", "7h", "0h"
   - p/P = [integer]

   "J: m (-)"         : Japanese time, m main-time left (absolute time, no extra-periods)
   "J: m (+ B * p)"   : Japanese time, m main-time left + extra-time (B time per move and p extra byo-yomi-periods left)
   "J: b (B * p)"     : Japanese time, in byo-yomi (no '+'), b byo-yomi-time left + extra-time (B time per move and p extra byo-yomi-periods left)
   "J: b (B * 0)"     : Japanese time, in byo-yomi (no '+'), b byo-yomi-time left, last byo-yomi-period

   "C: m (-)"         : Canadian time, m main-time left (absolute time, no extra-time)
   "C: m (+ B / P)"   : Canadian time, m main-time left + extra-time (B time per P stones)
   "C: b / p (B / P)" : Canadian time, in byo-yomi (no '+'), b byo-yomi-time left for p stones to play (extra-time is B time per P stones)

   "F: m (-)"         : Fischer time, m main-time left (absolute time, no extra-time)
   "F: m (+ B)"       : Fischer time, m main-time left + extra-time (B time extra per move)

* abbreviated time (T='J/C/F' for JAP/CAN/FIS-time):
  for short-format time will always be given in hours (e.g. "51h", "240h")!


#-------- (1) Japanese Byo-yomi -----------------------------------------------

Format: "J: M + B * P"

      M = start main-time
      B = start byo-yomi-time (byotime)
      P = start byo-yomi-periods (byoper)

      m = remaining main-time during game
      b = remaining byo-time (within started byo-yomi period)
      p = remaining byo-periods

   Absolute time (i.e. no byo-yomi): M>0, B<=0, P>=0
   Time with byo-yomi:               M>=0, B>0, P>0

Functioning:

   When clock is running ...
      main-time M is counted down to 0,
         then byo-yomi period starts reducing byoper p by 1 and setting byotime b to start-byo-time B
         byo-time is counted down to 0, then new byo-yomi period starts
         if move is played with b>0, b is resetted to start-byo-time B
   Time is up, when no main-time and no byo-time left: m=0, b=0

Database representation:

   type/M/B/P is stored in table Games in fields:
      Byotype='J', Maintime, Byotime, Byoperiods

   remaining-time m/b/p is stored in table Games in fields:
      (Black|White)_Maintime/_Byotime/_Byoperiods

   time-setup at game-start: m=M, b=0, p=-1

   byo-yomi has been entered (once) if: p>=0
      p is preserved after time-adding without byo-yomi reset

   being in byo-yomi if: m=0



#-------- (2) Canadian Byo-yomi -----------------------------------------------

Format: "C: M + B / P"

      M = start main-time
      B = start byo-yomi-time (byotime)
      P = start byo-yomi-stones (byoper)

      m = remaining main-time during game
      b = remaining byo-time (within started byo-yomi period)
      p = remaining stones in byo-yomi-period

   Absolute time (i.e. no byo-yomi): M>0, B<=0, P>=0
   Time with byo-yomi:               M>=0, B>0, P>0

Functioning:

   When clock is running ...
      main-time M is counted down to 0,
         then byo-yomi period starts b=B and p=P
         byo-time is counted down to 0 and byo-stone p is counted down by 1 stone for each move
         if all byo-stones are played within byo-yime, b and p are resetted
   Time is up, when no main-time, or no byo-time left while byo-stones > 0 : m=0, b=0, p>0

Database representation:

   type/M/B/P is stored in table Games in fields:
      Byotype='C', Maintime, Byotime, Byoperiods

   remaining-time m/b/p is stored in table Games in fields:
      (Black|White)_Maintime/_Byotime/_Byoperiods

   b>0 and p>=0 while m>0 is an invalid state

   time-setup at game-start: m=M, b=0, p=-1

   byo-yomi has been entered (once) if: p>=0
      p is preserved after time-adding without byo-yomi reset

   being in byo-yomi if: m=0


#-------- (3) Fischer time ----------------------------------------------------

Format: "F: M + B"

      M = start main-time
      B = extra-time for each played move

      m = remaining main-time during game

   Absolute time (i.e. no byo-yomi): M>0, B<=0, P=0
   Time with extra-time:             M>=0, B>0, P=0

Functioning:

   When clock is running ...
      main-time M is counted down,
         for each move played extra-time B is added to main-time m
   Time is up, when no main-time left : m=0

Database representation:

   type/M/B/P=0 is stored in table Games in fields:
      Byotype='F', Maintime, Byotime, Byoperiods=0

   remaining-time m/b=0/p=-1 is stored in table Games in fields:
      (Black|White)_Maintime/_Byotime/_Byoperiods

   time-setup at game-start: m=M, b=0, p=-1
