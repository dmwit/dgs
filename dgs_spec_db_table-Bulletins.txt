### Description of mysql tables:  Bulletin
###

Here you'll find some infos about all the bulletin-board tables.

Legend:
   - B  = Bulletin
   - TD = Tournament Director
   - TP = Tournament Participant (registered player)
   - T  = Tournament, e.g. T-owner
   - UL = user-list
   - tid = tournament-id

Important Notes:
   - Life-Cycle of Bulletin (author = admin):
      - author = admin: NEW -> SHOW -> ARCHIVE (on expire-date or by admin)
      - author = non-admin:
         - (a)  NEW -> PENDING : ADM-ACK -> SHOW -> ARCHIVE (on expire-date or by admin)
         - (b1) NEW -> PENDING : ADM-NACK -> HIDDEN (back-to-author with AdminNote) -> PENDING
         - (b2) NEW -> PENDING : ADM-NACK -> DELETE

Permission-Matrix for writing bulletins:
   Who (user-type) is allowed to write what (Category) bulletins addressed
   to whom (TargetType) ?

   - NOTES:
     - normal user can NOT create bulletin (except PRIV_MSG for MP-games),
       but Admin must create and assign it to the author setting USER_EDIT-flag.
       Then user can update it!

   - Category = MAINT : server maintenance announcements
     - create allowed by Admin; Target: ALL, UL, MPG

   - Category = ADM_MSG : admin announcements, game-/user-admin-stuff, etc
     - create allowed by Admin; Target: ALL, UL, MPG

   - Category = TOURNEY : tournament announcement on DGS, for non-DGS tournaments use tournament-forum
     - create allowed by Admin; Target: ALL, UL, (MPG)
     - update allowed by user;  Target: ALL, UL

   - Category = TNEWS : tournament-specific news / announcements
     - create allowed by Admin, T-Admin, TD, T-owner; Target: TD (private T-news), TP (public T-news)

   - Category = FEATURE : feature-info
     - create allowed by Admin; Target: ALL, UL, TD, TP, MPG

   - Category = PRIV_MSG : user-to-users messages (non-Ads)
     - create allowed by Admin; Target: ALL, UL, TD, TP, MPG
     - create allowed by GP;    Target: MPG
     - update allowed by user;  Target: UL

   - Category = AD : user-to-users advertisements (=pay me money for something Go-related)
     - create allowed by Admin; Target: ALL, UL, (MPG)
     - update allowed by user;  Target: ALL, UL

Description:
   Table to store bulletins, mainly used for maintenance-announcements to all users,

   than the forums.
