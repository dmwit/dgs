description of quick_status: "current format of data-lines" for bulletins doesn't match sample bulletin line (and the meaning of "count" is not explained)
old complaint: no encodings discussed anywhere (even on newly created content like subject lines of bulletins)
time zone of quick-suite dates?
reference to db/table-Bulletin.txt instead of db/table-Bulletins.txt
TargetType MPG not listed in db/table-Bulletins.txt under the long-form descriptions of TargetType's
in the spec for quick-status, the "game" header doesn't have quotes around the game_type but the actual game descriptions do
sample quick-status output doesn't have handicaps in the sample output
